# KMeans Mall Analysis: Exploring Clusters in Customer Data

The project aims to analyze and segment customers in a mall dataset to provide valuable insights for business strategies.

**Data Loading and Exploration:**

Loaded and explored the mall customer dataset containing information about customers' age, annual income, and spending score.

**Data Preprocessing:**

Encoded the 'Genre' column using Label Encoding to convert categorical data into numerical format.

**Visualization:**

* Utilized matplotlib to visualize the distribution of customers based on annual income and spending score.
* Plotted clusters of male and female customers for a visual representation.

**K-Means Clustering:**

* Applied the K-Means algorithm to identify clusters in the dataset.
* Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
* Visualized the identified clusters and centroids.

**Interactive Visualization:**

Used Plotly Express for an interactive visualization of clusters based on annual income and spending score.

* **Evaluation:**

Calculated the Silhouette Score to evaluate the quality of the clustering.

**Dimensionality Reduction:**

Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA and t-SNE for 2D visualization of clustered data.

**Implementation from Scratch:**

Implemented the K-Means algorithm from scratch, providing a deeper understanding of the clustering process.

**Conclusion:**
The project concludes with a comprehensive analysis of customer segmentation in the mall dataset. Clusters are identified and visualized, providing valuable insights for business decisions. The project demonstrates the use of both built-in functions and a from-scratch implementation of the K-Means algorithm. The interactive visualizations enhance the understanding of customer segments based on their spending behavior.
